    Winnie really likes water. A lot. To the extent that Annaka got her a little yellow dragon themed life vest. At first, winnie outright abhorred the idea of wearing it. We tried putting it on her and she slithered out of it like a snake. However, we had a trick up our sleeves, we knew the perfect place to try it on her and get her to enjoy it, at the Corgi Meetup on Fiesta Island in San Diego.

    One day we were googling fun places to bring dogs in San Diego and we came across [The San Diego Corgi Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/sandiegocorgimeetup/) group. We saw they had lots of members with lots and lots of corgis, AND, they were having a meetup in the not too distant future! After making an account and signing up, we looked at some of the other corgis who were attending. We couldn't wait to meet them all and we were sure Winnie was going to have a blast (even with the life vest).
  
 &emsp; 
  Fast forward to the day of the meetup, we got out of bed in the wee early morning at 9am (pretty early for a weekend morning), to an already awake and busy chewing something Winnie. She had a lot of energy that day and it was perfect because she was going to need a lot of it for playing and swimming on the beach. After packing up and eating breakfast, we left for the meetup a little late, but still at an ok time. The drive went pretty fast and parking onsite was pretty ok, we found a spot rather quickly right next to an entrance to the dog beach. After looking at the meeting location on a very handily provided map, we set out towards it with Winnie in tow. Cresting just one ridge led us to an amazing view of the bay and more importantly, a big group of corgis hanging out by the water. 
  
  &emsp; 
  We let Winnie run around and swim a bit without the life vest. But, since she enjoyed the water so much and kept going back in, we strapped her in to the life vest and saw how she did. She actually got into it very nicely and didn't slither out this time. She kept going back into the water and swimming circles around us, other people, and other corgis. I think she ended up being one of the best swimmers there. Winnie played with tons of other corgis there of all shapes, sizes, and colors.

  After a while of swimming and running around, we went with some others on a walk along the beach. The idea was it would help all the corgis dry out before going back in cars. This didn't really work for Winnie as she kept going back in the water, but the top half of her kind of dried out. So partial success. The walk ended with us heading back to the car to rinse off Winnie's sandy feet and then wrapping her up wiht a towel like a little corgi burrito. She was sooo tired and happy.
